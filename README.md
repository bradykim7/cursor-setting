# agcoco

> **agcoco** = **Ag**ent-**Co**ding-**Co**nfig — pronounced "AG-co-co".
> Personal dotfiles repo for AI agent-assisted coding.

Manages custom slash commands, sub-agents, skills, and per-tool symlinks for any CLI that follows the `AGENTS.md` convention (Claude Code, Codex, and easily extensible to Gemini / Cursor / Aider / Continue via `tools/<name>.sh`).

## Architecture

![agcoco architecture](./architecture.png)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo-url> ~/agcoco
cd ~/agcoco
./install.sh
```

## How it works

Three ways to fire a workflow — a slash command you type, a skill that auto-fires from your phrasing, or a sub-agent the running command spawns. The core agent loop reads context, plans, fans out to specialists, and folds findings back into a single answer.

- **Commands** (`/foo`) — you invoke explicitly. Full workflows.
- **Skills** — auto-fire when your phrasing matches the `description` field. No slash needed.
- **Agents** — Claude spawns them automatically inside a command. Specialized single tasks.

### Skills (22)

Ported from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT). Skills auto-fire when your phrasing matches their `description` field — no slash command needed.

| Category | Skill | Triggers when you say… |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| **engineering** | `setup-matt-pocock-skills` | "set up the engineering skills for this repo" — run first in any new project |
| | `grill-with-docs` | "stress-test this plan against our domain model" |
| | `to-prd` | "turn this conversation into a PRD" |
| | `to-issues` | "break this plan into issues" |
| | `triage` | "triage these incoming issues" |
| | `tdd` | "let's TDD this", "red-green-refactor" |
| | `diagnose` | "diagnose this bug", "this is broken/throwing/failing" |
| | `improve-codebase-architecture` | "find refactoring opportunities", "improve architecture" |
| | `prototype` | "let me prototype this", "try a few UI variations" |
| | `zoom-out` | "zoom out", "give me the bigger picture" |
| **productivity** | `grill-me` | "grill me on this plan", "interview me" |
| | `caveman` | (terse output mode) |
| | `write-a-skill` | "create a new skill" |
| **misc** | `git-guardrails-claude-code` | "block dangerous git commands", "add git safety hooks" |
| | `setup-pre-commit` | "set up pre-commit hooks", "add Husky + lint-staged" |
| | `migrate-to-shoehorn` | "replace `as` with shoehorn in tests" |
| | `scaffold-exercises` | "scaffold an exercise structure" |
| **personal** | `edit-article` | "edit/revise this article" |
| | `obsidian-vault` | "find/create a note in Obsidian" |
| **in-progress** | `writing-fragments` | "ideate", "fragments", "raw material" |
| | `writing-shape` | "shape these notes into an article" |
| | `writing-beats` | "assemble this as a narrative" |

### Plugins (6)

Commands and skills also ship as installable plugin packs in `plugins/`. Cherry-pick a pack — you don't have to adopt the whole config.

```bash
/plugin marketplace add mskim/Agcoco
/plugin install engineering-skills@agcoco
/plugin install workflow@agcoco
```

<img src="./docs/images/agcoco-08-plugins.png" alt="6 marketplace bundles" width="720">

### Hooks (4)

Non-LLM scripts that run on tool invocation or session events. The agent doesn't choose to honour them — the runtime enforces them.

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `block-dangerous-git.sh` | PreToolUse: Bash | Block `git commit/push/filter-repo/reset --hard` — require human approval |
| `workcheck-reminder.sh` | PreToolUse: Bash | Warn before commit if no smoke test report exists |
| `session-start-ticket-context.sh` | SessionStart | Auto-load `.plans/`, `.handoffs/`, `.research/` for JIRA ticket branches |
| `obsidian-save-reminder.sh` | Stop | Nudge to save learnings to the Obsidian vault |

## Multi-Tool Support (`tools/` registry)

Tool-agnostic — `install.sh` runs a generic loop over `tools/*.sh`, auto-detects whatever CLIs are installed, and creates the declared symlinks. `AGENTS.md` is the **canonical** agent context (openclaw pattern); each tool's expected memory filename is a symlink to it.

<img src="./docs/images/agcoco-01-input.png" alt="One config, many CLIs" width="720">

**Shipped (verified):**

| File | Tool | Detection | Symlinks created |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tools/claude.sh` | Claude Code | `command -v claude` | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md`, `commands`, `agents`, `skills`, `settings.json` |
| `tools/codex.sh` | Codex CLI | `command -v codex` | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` → `AGENTS.md`, `skills` (same SKILL.md format) |

<img src="./docs/images/agcoco-03-integration.png" alt="One source, symlinked everywhere" width="720">

**Add any other tool** — Gemini, Cursor agent, Aider, Continue, etc:

```bash
cp tools/_template.sh tools/<your-tool>.sh
$EDITOR tools/<your-tool>.sh    # fill in 4 vars: TOOL_NAME, TOOL_CMD, TOOL_DIR, TOOL_SYMLINKS
./install.sh                    # auto-detected from the next run on
```

`_template.sh` has commented-out example definitions for Gemini, Cursor, Aider, and Continue. See `tools/README.md` for the convention details. Tools whose CLI isn't installed are listed under the "skipped tools" section and skipped silently.

## Memory & State

Plain Markdown on disk is the memory. Plans, research notes, and handoffs all live as files the agent can read on the next session, on the next branch, or from a different machine — context survives the chat window.

<img src="./docs/images/agcoco-09-memory.png" alt="Markdown on disk is the memory" width="720">

### Project Init

```bash
./install.sh init /path/to/project
```

Creates `CLAUDE.md` + `.handoffs/` + `.plans/` + `.research/` in the target project.

### Obsidian Vault Init

Bootstraps an Obsidian vault for accumulating company knowledge + development knowledge.

```bash
./install.sh obsidian-init ~/Documents/MyVault
```

Creates a vault with:
- Folder structure (`20-Company/` for company knowledge, `30-Development/` for general dev knowledge — kept separate)
- 7 note templates (daily, meeting, ADR, tech knowledge, troubleshooting, glossary, weekly review)
- Claude Code integration (`CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/commands/` with 3 slash commands)
- Auto-configured Obsidian core plugins

→ Follow the [Obsidian Onboarding Guide](docs/obsidian-onboarding.md) (10 minutes)

## Output

Every workflow produces a concrete file or message — not just a chat reply. Commit messages follow team convention, PR descriptions write themselves, test reports get checked in for the next session to read.
