# Slash Commands

Slash commands for Claude Code. Each `.md` file under [`commands/`](../commands/) is invoked as `/<filename>`.

`install.sh` symlinks the `commands/` directory into `~/.claude/commands/`. Routing rules — when each command auto-fires from natural phrasing — live in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#intent-routing--natural-phrasing--action).

## Conventions

- Filename = command name (no leading slash).
- Frontmatter `description:` is what's shown above.
- Korean and English commands are both supported; routing matches phrasing in either language.

## Adding a new command

1. Drop `your-command.md` in [`commands/`](../commands/) with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: One-line summary shown in /help and this README
   ---
   ```
2. Re-run `./install.sh` from the repo root to symlink it into `~/.claude/commands/`.
3. If it should auto-fire from natural phrasing, add a routing entry in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#intent-routing--natural-phrasing--action).
